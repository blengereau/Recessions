# Recession Forecasting with Logit and Random Forests
This project explores ways to enhance the predictive power of a logit model and a random forest in identifying U.S. recessions. We compare different sets of regressors: classic macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment), factors from a PCA on the full FRED-MD dataset, and factors estimated using a Bayesian Sparse Factor Model.
